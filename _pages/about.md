Welcome! I received my Ph.D degree from Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter, UK. Before that, I worked and studied at the University of Otago, New Zealand, and Beihang University (previously known as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, abbreviated as BUAA or Beihang), Beijing, China.
