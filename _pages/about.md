Before that, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the Chair of High Performance Computing, Helmut-Schmidt-Universität/Universität der Bundeswehr Hamburg [(HSU/UniBwH)](https://www.hsu-hh.de/)-University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Germany, working on the "Smartship" Project. I have a multidisciplinary background, having received a Ph.D. degree from the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), UK. in [Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/), and graduated from the [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, with a M.Sc. in Control Science & Engineering, and a B.Eng in Mechanical Engineering.-->

My research interests include:

* Mobile edge computing
* Internet of things
* Intelligent transportation systems
* Decision-making strategies for future mobile networks
 <br />

I am also enthusiastic to teach and work with highly motivated students, and very excited to see students making progress. In qualification, I am an Associate Fellow of UKPSF (also in the last stage of the PGCAP process) for teaching and supporting learning in higher education, recognized by Advance HE.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am very fortunate to work with many talented researchers and warm people, so I want to thank my Ph.D. supervisors, postdoc advisor, my students, my co-authors, my colleagues, my collaborators and everyone who has supported me and encouraged me to work on my research that not only contributes to advances of the field, but also can lead to the impact across multiple sectors in the real world.
