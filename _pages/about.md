Welcome! I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the James Watt School of Engineering, Univeristy of Glasgow, UK &#127468;&#127463;. Before this, I was a Lecturer in [Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/computer-and-information-sciences/) at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw57exBhAsEiwAaIxaZnjC1q4FOIwACdKiRwnHn0kLzRrtg_LVhJFfwNx7Ll7n5b3-RG9BqRoCEHsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), UK &#127468;&#127463; and a visiting researcher at Georg-August-University of G√∂ttingen, Germany &#127465;&#127466;. Earlier in my career, I worked as a Postdoctoral researcher in the Chair of High Performance Computing, Helmut-Schmidt-Universit√§t/Universit√§t der Bundeswehr Hamburg ([HSU/UniBwH](https://www.hsu-hh.de/))/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Germany &#127465;&#127466;.
<!-- and was a research candidate in Computer Science at University of Otago, New Zealand üá≥üáø.-->

I received my Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/) from the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), UK &#127468;&#127463;, supported by the International Excellence Scholarship. Prior to that, I graduated from the Beihang University, Beijing, China &#127464;&#127475;. I hold a M.Sc. degree in Control Science & Engineering, and a B.Eng degree in Mechanical Engineering. This multidisciplinary training bridges engineering and computer science, and underpins both my research and teaching.
