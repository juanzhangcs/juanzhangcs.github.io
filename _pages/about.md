I have a multidisciplinary background, having received a Ph.D. degree from the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), UK. in [Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/), and graduated from the [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, with a M.Sc. in Control Science & Engineering, and a B.Eng in Mechanical Engineering.-->

My research interests include:

* Mobile edge computing
* Internet of things
* Intelligent transportation systems
* Decision-making strategies for future mobile networks
 <br />

I am also enthusiastic to teach and work with highly motivated students, and very excited to see students making progress. In qualification, I am an Associate Fellow of UKPSF (also in the last stage of the PGCAP process) for teaching and supporting learning in higher education, recognized by Advance HE.
